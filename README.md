What this YouTube video and comment below what you learned: https://youtu.be/R54neaLznFA

# What I learned: 
- Node runs the backend(server side); NPM runs the frontend (client side).
- The proxy is the backend server.
- Styling for frontend was done under render in the app.js file using ReactStrap.. 
- Concurrently allows front and back end servers to run at the same time. 
- <NavLink href [link] goes to the repository when it's created.
